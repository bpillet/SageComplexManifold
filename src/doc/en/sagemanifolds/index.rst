SageManifolds Reference Manual
==============================

This is the reference manual for the 
`SageManifolds <http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/>`_ extension to the 
`Sage <http://sagemath.org/>`_ mathematical software system. 
Sage is free open source math software that 
supports research and teaching in algebra, geometry, number theory, 
cryptography, and related areas. 
SageManifolds implements differential geometry and tensor calculus in Sage, 
via a set of new Python classes. 

This reference manual contains many examples that illustrate the
usage of SageManifolds. All examples are tested with each release of 
SageManifolds, and should produce exactly the same output as in this manual, 
except for line breaks. More documentation (including some tutorial and example 
worksheets) can be found at 
`http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr <http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/documentation.html>`_
